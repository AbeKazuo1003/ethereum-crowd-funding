# Instruction

## Objective
* Create a `upgradable`, `pausable` __crowdfunding__ smart contract which can be used as a _template_ by every __project owner__.

## Features
* The project owner is able to set these params:
	- startTimestamp & endTimestamp of timeline duration
	- it's wallet address
	- min. funding threshold (in USD)
* Condition for SC activation:
	- the project owner sends the allocated supply to the contract after deployment
* Commission:
	- Protocol fees
		+ collected during investment (sure) & withdrawal (not sure). The fees during withdrawal is to be decided later during based on DAO governance based decision making.
	- Project owner fees
		+ collected during investment (not sure) & withdrawal (not sure). The decision is pending from the market & project.
* Investor roles:
	- invest money via `iinvest()` function in stablecoins (like USDC, USDT, etc.) or unstablecoins (like ETH, BSC, WBTC, RBTC, etc.).
		+ project tokens to be minted
		+ protocol fees to be deducted & stored as escrow for the protocol wallet address.
		+ project commission fees to be deducted & stored as escrow for the project owner.
	- withdraw money via `iwithdrawFund()` function by depositing minted tokens (gets burned) & receives in stablecoins or unstablecoins.
		+ Case-1: If the investor invested in USDC, then during withdrawal, it receives in USDC.
		+ Case-2: If the investor invested in unstablecoins, they will be given the option to receive in either stable or unstable coins. The swap happens via an DEX interface attached with the contract.
	- reclaim fund via `ireclaimFund()` function, when the min. funding threshold (set by the project owner) is not reached within the timeline.
		+ This can be done post the timeline only if the min. funding threshold (min. USD fund to be raised) is NOT reached within the timeline.
	- claim project coin via `iclaimCoin()` function.
		+ This can be done post the timeline only if the min. funding threshold (min. USD fund to be raised) is reached within the timeline.
* Project owner roles:
	- withdraw deposited coins via `withdrawCoin()` function
		+ This can be done post the timeline only if the min. funding threshold (min. USD fund to be raised) is NOT reached within the timeline.
	- claim fees via `claimFees()` function
		+ This can be done at any point of time after the min. funding threshold (min. USD fund to be raised) is reached within the timeline.
	- claim Funding via `claimFund()` function
		+ This can be done post the timeline only if the min. funding threshold (min. USD fund to be raised) is reached within the timeline.
* Protocol owner roles:
	- claim commission fees via `tclaimFees()`
		+ This can be done at any point of time after the min. funding threshold (min. USD fund to be raised) is reached within the timeline.
* Get price:
	- function: `getPrice()`
	- view price of the project token
	- This depends on Bonding curve equation.
* Utils:
	- Create a utility library which will contain all the mathematical calculations and will be used inside the functions of the main contract.
	- functions include
		+ `_calculatePrice()`: calculate real-time price (in USD) of project token.
		+ `isFundingTh()`: is Funding threshold reached.
			- deduct the protocol fees, project owner fees & then check if the totalFundingAmt >= fundingThreshold
